--February 7, 2010--
- Prevented creation of "theme" projects since there are no templates for it.
- Connected sourceDirectoryChanged() to a slot that destructive-refreshes
  any open editor's contents. Timeline works beautifully now! \o/

--February 6, 2010--
- Added basic git ignore capabilities
- Added sourceDirectoryChanged to notify when the git repo is changed
  (now, we have to connect it to the editor, to refresh the view)

--January 27, 2010--
- Limited recent project list on startpage to showing 5 projects.
- Added "More Projects" button to startpage, as well as a beginning
  implementation of a Project Management Dialog, that currently only
  loads projects.

--January 21, 2010--
- Added not-so-pretty-but-usable (I think :P ) find text functionality
  to documentation widget.

--January 11, 2010--
- Added python runner template, fixed encoding signature and runner creation.
- Fixed silly crash happening when starting PlasMate and then closing it.

--December 9, 2009--
- Refactored the Sidebar in order to inherit from QTableWidget, now it can
  be placed both in vertical and horizontal position; btw it need some 
  polishing yet =)
- Fixed font rendering, now it doesn't cut the ending of the string
- Updated older and obsolete includes

--December 6,2009--

  it the next time PlasMate starts.

--December 5, 2009--
- Rewritten the TimeLine widget in order to allow the user to place it both
  in vertical and horizontal position.

--November 30,2009--

  instead of showing the 'select a file' QWidget.

--November 29,2009--

  are no longer reloaded, but are remembered and restored as the user
  switches between them.

--November 28,2009--
- Added simple documentation widget.

--November 23,2009--
- Reverted 'Recent project list' to showing plasmoid names and fixed
  so it works. Import plasmoids now works.

- Added preliminary support for importing plasmoids.
  'Recent project list' now shows project folder names instead of 
  plasmoid names to avoid confusion.

--November 15,2009--
- Added a simple, draft publisher widget. Exporting and installing plasmoids
  work, but online publishing doesn't for now.

--November 14,2009--
- New files can now be added to the project by clicking 'New' in the editor
  tree, and existing files can be deleted by doing a right-click > Delete.

--November 13,2009--
- Editor tree now dynamically reflects changes in the directory

--October 27,2009--
- Restored previewer dockwidget (while retaining previewer tab for now).
  Previewer refresh button now asks the mainwindow to save any unsaved
  data so that the preview is up to date. Also added a 'Refresh Previewer'
  menubar item with a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-F5 for now) that does the same.

--October 26,2009--
- Editor contents are now automagically saved on swapping files/tabs and
  on exit.

--October 19,2009--

  now in a tab of its own.

--October 18,2009--
- Selecting metadata now brings up the metadata editor GUI - but it doesn't
  really work.

--October 1,2009--
- Experimental separation of editor tree-widget into a QDockWidget. Still
  UGLY and BUGGY.

--September 26,2009--
- Package metadata file is now visible and editable in the editor.

--September 25, 2009--
- Fixed more editor issues : all tree widget entries are now correctly named
  and properly mapped to their respective files.

--September 23, 2009--
- Fixed clicking certain files in the editor component tree widget causing plasmate
  to crash. Issues remaining for editor:
    - File entries are not properly named in editor's project structure tree.
    - metadata.desktop is not currently editable (or visible).

--September 20, 2009--
- Editor component now makes a (buggy) attempt to load clicked project files
  with an editor kpart. Also fixed a bug causing editor kpart to
  not load the first time the editor component is loaded.

--September 19, 2009--
- Fixed previewer refresh code: Refreshing now properly reflects changes since previous
  refresh. Also fixed issue with refreshed plasmoid being smaller than original.

--September 12, 2009--
- Loading a project now also attempts to load a preview in previewer

--August 29, 2009--
- Modified the newSavePoint() method to prevent a crash when the user want to store his first 
  SavePoint, but then it discard the "new SavePoint" dialog.

--August 22, 2009--
- Added titles to the previewer tool menus.

--August 14, 2009--

  used to create new SavePoints.

  characters when the user types a new branch name.
- Starting writing apidox documentation, removin useless methods and fixing style.

--August 10, 2009--
- Fixed StartPage issue: opening/creating a project, when an other one is already open, now
  works.
- TimeLine didn't reload properly when changing from an existing project to an other. Fixed.

--August 9, 2009--
- Moved "New SavePoint" buttom from timeline to workflow dock widget. Changed workflow
  signals connection in order to restore the previous tab after setting a SavePoint.
- Added bool GitRunner::hasNewChangesToCommit(), so New SavePoint dialog is triggered only if
  there are uncommitted changes.
- Moved "On Section: <name>" button on the top of TimeLine dock for usability reason, because
  if there are lots of SavePoints, the user has to scroll down each time he want to perfom an
  action Section-related.
- Fixed plasma-containment-studiopreviewer.desktop file; now it doesn't interacts with 
  "Desktop Settings" -> "Desktop Activity" entries.
- Some fixes and coding style fix.

--August 3, 2009--
- When creating a new project, metadata.desktop file is filled with the required fields
- Added setAuthor and setEmail to GitRunner class, so now TimeLine can set that fields
- Review createNewProject code.
- Fixed some krazy warnings.

--July 30, 2009--
- New Project page displays now two fields, Author and Email, defaulted to <username> and
  <username>@none.org. These values are inserted in the header contained int the main script
  file.

--July 29, 2009--
- Fixed saving/reloading layout ( still need some fixing with previewer dimensions btw )
- Now templates are installed under $KDEDIR/share/apps/plasmate/templates
- When creating a new project, PlasMate makes a copy of the corresponding template in the
  working directory, modify its file name and the main class to match the project name. 

--July 26, 2009--
- Added radio button to select the scripting language, connected KLineEdit::returnPressed()
  signal, saved docks position so the next time PlasMate is loaded, it reloads docks previous
  position ( need more fixing btw ).
- Added templated folder, with simple sources for plasmoid and data engines.

--July 25, 2009--
- The loading of a text editor at the Publish tab was unnecessary. Removed.
- Cancel button added to new project screen.

--July 21, 2009--
- Fixed the issue with the KRestrictedLine form; now it accepts correctly all names composed by
  characters a-z,A-Z,0-9, and "_", "."

--July 19, 2009--
- Added merge capabilities to TimeLine class.

--July 17, 2009--
- TimeLine now is able to create/delete branches, move to a selected commit ( creating also a new
  branch to preserve other commits ), restore the current state to whatever commit ( deleting all
  the commits performed after it, in the same branch ), init itself and save commits.

--July 14, 2009--
- Now the TimeLine sets-up a menu for each item, available by right-clicking on it: implemented the
  switch branch feature.

--July 12, 2009--
- Fixed a strange behaviour with GitRunner class which causes the app to continue runnig, even if
  the app is closed. Extended TimeLine class; now it shows in the main window the current branches
  and its related commits, and more infos are provided when moving the mouse over the icons.

--July 7, 2009--
- Fixed DvcsJob behaviour when are performed sequential calls, like in the unit test.
  Added the following action in the GitRunner class: remove, status, log, reset, newBranch,
  switchBranch, branches.

--July 5, 2009--
- Splitted the Sidebar class, coded the following git action: init, add, commit, isValidDirectory
  and clone ( only with local repo, for now ). Wrote a simple test case, and start integrating it
  in the timeline class.

--June 1, 2009--
-Appropriate kpart shown when an item is selected from the tree in the Edit tab.

--June 24, 2009--
-Simple 'Pick wallpaper plugin' functionality added to previewer
