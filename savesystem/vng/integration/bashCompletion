	# bash> vng push ~/space in there-0.
	# ~/space in there-0.1 ~/space in there-0.2
	# and we have introduced two spaces in the command line (if we try to
	# recomplete that, it won't find anything, as it doesn't know anything
	# starting with "there-0.").
	# printf %q will gracefully add the necessary backslashes.

	# bash> vng pull http:http://example.org/repo
	# An option would be to require the user to escape : as \: and we
	# would do the same here. Instead, we return only the part after
	# the last colon that is already there, and thus fool bash. The
	# downside is that bash only shows this part to the user.
